            Outputs an HTML report file to location
            Set --html=false if you want to disable it

        --threads=<number> [#cpus]
            The number of cpus that will be used to stress test
```

Example:

`stresser http://example.com/page.html -c 10000 -n 10 -t 20000 --html=/home/reports/report-$(date +%s).html --threads=16 --force`

## Reading the stats
_Example:_
```
  S=    10 |   T=    96 |   A=     0
  E=     0 | T/O=    96 | W/B=     0 | AVG=     0 | MIN=     0 | MAX=     0
1xx=     0 | 2xx=     0 | 3xx=     0 | 4xx=     0 | 5xx=     0
NOT FINISHED=4
```

### Legend:
 - S   = Number of Seconds since the test was started
 - T   = Number of requests completed in the given amount of time
 - A   = Number of requests active (still awaiting a response)
 - E   = Number of requests failed 
 - T/O = Number of requests timed out
 - W/B = Number of requests that contain a response body
 - AVG = Average response time in milliseconds
 - MIN = Minimum response time in milliseconds
 - MAX = Maximum response time in milliseconds
 - 1xx = Number of HTTP code 100-199 responses
 - 2xx = Number of HTTP code 200-299 responses
 - 3xx = Number of HTTP code 300-399 responses
 - 4xx = Number of HTTP code 400-499 responses
 - 5xx = Number of HTTP code 500-599 responses
 - NOT FINISHED = Number of requests that are unanswered and have been forcefully terminated (see option --force)

## HTML output
The HTML file contains:
 - Aggregated stats described above
 - A bar chart with distribution of the response times
 - A line chart with second by second stats

## Support

For bugs and/or feature requests please refer to the [Github page](https://github.com/legraphista/stresser).

___

## Roadmap
 - Implement option to send custom headers ~~and custom body payload~~
 - Add pie chart with different http codes distribution 
 - Implement a slave / master system in order to stress test from multiple machines, for tests big enough (10k+) where the hardware becomes a bottleneck
